    <h1>What we are</h1>
    <p>We are seekers, dreamers, and visionaries - bound by a shared reverence for the Moon.
    Most importantly, however, is that we are people just like you. We are not yet above humanity.
    We are people bound by a shared reverence for the Moon, and we simply wish to enlighten more and more of those who have yet to be touched by its gentle rays.</p>
    <h1>What we Believe</h1>
    <p>The Moon is more than a celestial body; it is a symbol of balance, transformation, and hidden knowledge.
    Most of all, the Moon itself breathes and pulses with life. Through the Moon, we unify - its light touches all of us.
    The Circle invites all of those who have been called to partake in this unity, those who wish to embrace the lunar flow and open themselves to new dimensions of understanding.</p>

    <h1>Our Purpose</h1>
    <p>We exist to reconnect individuals with the ancient truth of the Moon's influence.
    Through unity and shared vision, we find meaning in its light, wisdom in its darkness, and purpose in its transitions.
    Whether waxing or waning, the Moon reveals all, and invites us to harmonize with the greater universe.</p>
    <p>Our teachings are simple, but profound - built on timeless knowledge, meditative practices, and the belief that the Moon guides us toward a higher state of being.
    Those who walk this path discover peace, clarity, and a deep sense of belonging.</p>
